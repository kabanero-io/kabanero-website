# Kabanero.io Website Release Process

## Overview
The content on the Kabanero.io Website is built from four different sources:
- Source Code of the Website from the repo that this document is in: https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-website
- Docs from: https://github.com/kabanero-io/docs
- Blogs from: https://github.com/kabanero-io/blogs
- The guides from repositories in https://github.com/kabanero-io that begin with `guide-`

## Website Release
The website has its own independent release process.  Releases are versioned using standard semantic versioning of format **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**.

When there is enough new content to publish, maintainers will cut a new release. Depending on the scope of the updates in the release, maintainers will decide which version to increment.
