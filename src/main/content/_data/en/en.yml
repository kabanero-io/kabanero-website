  intro-title: Kabanero Developer Experience for CLI
  intro-text: The Kabanero Development Experience for CLI is simply the Appsody CLI. Appsody provides Kabanero with simplicity in the creation of cloud-native applications in containers. Appsody provides pre-configured container images (stacks) and project templates for a growing set of popular open source runtimes and frameworks, providing a foundation on which to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments.
  video-link: Check out this video that shows the developer experience for a Node.js app.
  about-appsody: Appsody by itself points to a growing community of stacks (Container images pre-built with runtimes and frameworks). Kabanero provides integrated collections for a subset of these stacks. These are known as featured collections. When using Appsody with Kabanero, you point Appsody at your Collections.

  intro-title: Kabanero Developer Experience
  intro-text: Use Kabanero to build applications that are ready for deployment onto Kubernetes and Knative, without having to spend time defining container images, build infrastructure, or Kube yaml. Focus on developing new applications  and let the Kabanero tools do the heavy lifting of  building and packaging  deployment-ready containers. Go ahead and try it for yourself, either by using extensions for popular IDEs, or our command-line tools.

  developer-experience:
    description: The Kabanero Developer Experience includes two open source projects, Eclipse Codewind and Appsody. Learn more about them below.
    codewind: 
      text: Codewind provides Kabanero with IDE integration and extensions to popular IDEs like VS Code, Eclipse, and Eclipse Che (with more planned). This enables developers to use a workflow and IDE they already know. You can rapidly iterate, debug, and performance test apps inside containers with the same environment as production.

    eclips-microprofile-paragraph: Eclipse MicroProfile is a set of APIs used to optimize Java applications for a microservices architecture. With this stack, you can deliver microservices based upon the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications. Build and run high-quality applications with Open Liberty runtime, which includes OpenJDK with container-optimizations in OpenJ9.
    spring-paragraph: is a framework used in Java application development. With this application stack, you can deliver microservices based upon the Spring framework provided by Pivotal. Open Liberty runtime provides support for Spring applications with OpenJDK and container-optimizations in OpenJ9.
