  intro-title: Kabanero Developer Experience for CLI
  intro-text: The Kabanero Development Experience for CLI is simply the Appsody CLI. Appsody provides Kabanero with simplicity in the creation of cloud-native applications in containers. Appsody provides pre-configured container images (stacks) and project templates for a growing set of popular open source runtimes and frameworks, providing a foundation on which to build applications for Kubernetes and Knative deployments.
  video-link: Check out this video that shows the developer experience for a Node.js app.
  about-appsody: Appsody by itself points to a growing community of stacks (Container images pre-built with runtimes and frameworks). Kabanero provides integrated stacks for a subset of these stacks. These are known as featured stacks. When using Appsody with Kabanero, you point Appsody at your Stacks.

  intro-title: Kabanero Developer Experience for IDEs
  intro-text: Use Kabanero to build applications that are ready for deployment onto Kubernetes and Knative, without having to spend time defining container images, build infrastructure, or Kube yaml. Focus on developing new applications and let the Kabanero tools do the heavy lifting of building and packaging deployment-ready containers. Try it for yourself, using extensions to popular IDEs. If you are interested in a 
  cli-example-link: simple CLI experience, try it here

    eclips-microprofile-paragraph: Eclipse MicroProfile is a set of APIs used to optimize Java applications for a microservices architecture. With this stack, you can deliver microservices based upon the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications. Build and run high-quality applications with Open Liberty runtime, which includes OpenJDK with container-optimizations in OpenJ9.
    spring-paragraph: is a framework used in Java application development. With this application stack, you can deliver microservices based upon the Spring framework provided by Pivotal. Spring Boot applications run on OpenJDK.
    nodejs-paragraph: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that can execute JavaScript code anywhere, not limited to a browser. Due to its single-threaded nature, Node.js enables the creation of non-blocking and event-driven servers. It fits well in web-based frontends and backend API services for microservices-based applications.
