            <h1>Kabanero Foundation Installation</h1>
            <p>
                Kabanero is built on foundational open technologies that install onto a Kubernetes cluster.  Applications are deployed using an integrated Kubernetes-native toolchain using enterprise-grade deployments infused with Kubernetes expertise. 
                The applications being deployed will be based upon a set of curated collections, which this install will activate a default set of featured collections.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically this experience is performed by a cloud operations team, although anyone skilled in setting up Kubernetes can also install Kabanero.
