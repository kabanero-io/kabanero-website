            <hr/>

            <p>
                Kabanero is built on foundational open technologies that install onto a Kubernetes cluster. 
                Applications are deployed using an integrated Kubernetes-native toolchain using enterprise-grade deployments infused with Kubernetes expertise.
                The applications being deployed will be based upon a collection.  
                Kabanero Foundation installs the foundational open technologies (Knative, Istio, Tekton, kAppNav) then activates a default set of featured collections.
            </p>

            <p>
                This experience is typically performed by a cloud operations team, although anyone skilled in setting up Kubernetes can also install Kabanero.

            <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
            <p>
                Kabanero Foundation is installed in a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes must first be installed. Today Kabanero has been tested on the 
                Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) version 3.11. There is intent to also expand testing to additional distributions 
                including upstream Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift in the future.
