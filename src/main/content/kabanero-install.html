            <p>
                Kabanero is built on foundational open technologies that install onto a Kubernetes cluster. 
                Applications are deployed using an integrated Kubernetes-native toolchain using enterprise-grade deployments infused with Kubernetes expertise.
                The applications being deployed will be based upon a stack.  
                Kabanero Foundation installs the foundational open technologies (Knative, Istio, Tekton, kAppNav) then activates a default set of featured stacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                This experience is typically performed by a cloud operations team, although anyone skilled in setting up Kubernetes can also install Kabanero.
